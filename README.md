# Tomato Disease Classification with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project applies modern deep learning techniques to classify and diagnose diseases in tomato plants. Utilizing the publicly available "Tomato Diseases" dataset from Kaggle, this repository contains the implementation of various models including ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG, each tailored to recognize different diseases affecting tomato plants.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's Tomato Diseases dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luisolazo/tomato-diseases). It includes over 5,000 images across five categories, labeled and ready for training robust deep learning models.

- **Format**: JPEG
- **Resolution**: Variable
- **Quantity**: 5,000 images
- **Categories**: Bacterial spot, Late blight, Leaf mold, Yellow leaf curl virus, Healthy

## Prerequisites

- PyTorch 1.6 or newer
- Torchvision
- Python 3.6 or above

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```
